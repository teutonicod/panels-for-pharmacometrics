# panels-for-pharmacometrics
Overview
Small collection of panel functions which can be used within lattice high-level functions.

Most of the functions are designed in particular for PK and PD data, for this reason the panel functions are mainly conceived to represent longitudinal variables vs. time.

The package contains also some strip functions to change the panel design.
